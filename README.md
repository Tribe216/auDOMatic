## CrossTire

### Background

You'll get caught up in the .... Cross Tire!

CrossTire is a browser game based on the classic action board game Crossfire by the Milton Bradley Company. It is a two player game in which each player attempts to knock a tire or tires initially placed in the center of the game board into the opposing player's pit by shooting ball bearings out of a pivoting launcher.

### Features and MVP  

The main features of the game will be:

- [ ] Start a new two player game
- [ ] Select ball bearing speed, a well as directional and power variance
- [ ] Pivot the launcher and launch ball bearings into the game area

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] A landing modal containing directions and credits
- [ ] A production README

### Wireframes

CrossFire will consist of two screens: a landing and a game page.

Th landing page will feature the game logo along with directions and a credits section with links to the related Github repository and LinkedIn page. It will also feature game options which will modify the bahavior of the launched ball bearings.

The main game screen will consist of the game board and game elements as well as score counters and a link to start a new game, which will direct the players back to the landing page.

### Game Architecture

CrossTire will be built upon these technologies:

- JavaScript, React and jQuery for structure, state, and logic.
- SoundJs for rendering sounds
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering graphics
- Webpack to aggregate the scripts into an entry file

The game will user the following files:

`landing.js`: this will render and capture state changes on the landing page for later use

`board.js`: this will hold the logic for creating and maintaining state of the game board

`piece.js`: this will hold the common properties and logic to the game pieces

`tire.js`: this will hold the properties properties and logic to the tire pieces

`bearing.js`: this will hold the common properties and logic to the ball bearing pieces


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**:

- set up all Javascript libraries as well as Webpack
- write basic backend for board and game pieces
- write basic landing page
- use Canvas and Easel to render the game board and pieces statically

**Day 2**:

- modify pieces so they are able to move
- render moving pieces
- add collision logic to game pieces and/or board bounds
- add point scored and game over detection

**Day 3**:

- add more extensive styling to game assets
- add functionality to landing page which will change game conditions
- add sounds and possibly music as time allows
- finish up various bugs and clean up code
